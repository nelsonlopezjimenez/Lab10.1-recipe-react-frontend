# React Project Todo

- Cleanup functions in `./src/api.js` and reference them in `App.js` or wherever API calls are handled
- Fix CSS issues
- Make sure the RecipeFormIngredientInput is resetting properly on form reset
  - Should I manage the state of NewIngredient in RecipeForm rather than RecipeFormIngredientInput? That's where the other state is managed and `handleReset` lives
- Wire up the form so that the ingredient list works properly
- Make the form submit to a route that can create recipes
- Make a filter/search for the recipes
- Make a way to favorite/bookmark recipes
- Look into image uploading for the form?
